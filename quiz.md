# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz
## Polymorphism

### 1. What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?

Answerï¼š "Polymorphism" means One object can have many forms. 

### 2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

Answer: When we apply polymorphism to OO design, it means a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a 
single symbol to represent multiple different types.    

### 3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

Answer: In Java, we can use abstract class or interface to implement polymorphism. 

### 4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

Answer: As many as need. 

### 5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

Answer: As we discussed in 3, java allow us to use abstract class or interface to implement polymorphism. But when we use 
abstract class and when we use interface has a little different. 



## Composition
### 1. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

Answer: Reference to OOP, 'composition' means an instance of a class can be a property of another class object. 

### 2. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
Answer: If the property is complex and cannot be defined by a primary type like int, double. We should use composition. 
Composition property can be a user-defined class or java build in class like String, ArrayList. 

```
public class Battery{
  private int range;
}

public class Camera{
  private String typeOfLens;
}

public class MobilePhone{
  private Battery battery;
  private ArrayList<Camera> cameras;
}
```

### 3. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
Answer: a. Make the code easy to understand and maintain.
        b. The main object of class has an instance of property class. Means, the property class can be 
        encapsulated and focused on the jobs it should do.         

### 4. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
Answer: All destroyed.
